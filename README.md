## Overview
## The challenge
-The challenge was to build a recipe page and make it look as close as the reference design in both desktop version and mobile version.

## My process
- First, I started by analyzing the structure of the page based on the images provided. Then, I built it according to the flow of the recipe page using semantic HTML. Next, I added the styles and placed it in css variables. After ensuring that all of the styles I need are included, I started developing the page. I initialized git to manage the version history and uploaded my local version to my remote repository on my github account. After I achieved what I am going for, I proceeded to fixing the mobile responsiveness of the page and then uploaded the recipe page on github pages.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- how to manipulate ol and ul elements and how to use the ::marker pseudo code


### Continued development
-I still have a lot to explore in front-end development, but I am really interested in making web motion designs.

### Useful resources
- I just mostly used edge's Copilot since it seeks answers from the web so basically it's like a shortcut, it is also very insightful when answering some queries that I have.
